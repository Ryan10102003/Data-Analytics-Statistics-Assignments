        "\n",
        "1. What is a random variable in probability theory?\n",
        "  - A random variable is a function that assigns numerical values to the outcomes of a random experiment. It can be **discrete** (countable) or **continuous** (measurable).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What are the types of random variables?\n",
        "  - The two main types of random variables are discrete (takes countable values) and continuous (takes values from an interval).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?\n",
        "  - Discrete distributions deal with countable outcomes (e.g., rolling a die), while continuous distributions deal with measurable outcomes over an interval (e.g., height, weight).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
        "  - A probability distribution function (PDF) gives the probability that a random variable takes a specific value (discrete) or falls within a range (continuous). For continuous variables, the PDF is a curve where the area under the curve gives probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
        "  - A PDF shows the probability of a specific value (or range), while a CDF gives the probability that a variable is less than or equal to a value. CDF is the integral (area under the curve) of the PDF.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is a discrete uniform distribution?\n",
        "  - A discrete uniform distribution assigns equal probabilities to all outcomes in a finite set, like rolling a fair die where each side has a 1/6 chance.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the key properties of a Bernoulli distribution?\n",
        "  - A Bernoulli distribution has two outcomes (0 and 1) with probability **p** for 1 (success) and **1−p** for 0 (failure). Its mean is **p**, and variance is **p(1−p)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the binomial distribution, and how is it used in probability?\n",
        "  - The binomial distribution models the number of successes in **n** independent Bernoulli trials with probability **p** of success. It's used to calculate probabilities of getting a certain number of successes in repeated experiments.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?\n",
        "  - The Poisson distribution models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, with a known average rate **λ**. It is used in scenarios like call center volume, traffic flow, or decay rates in physics.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is a continuous uniform distribution?\n",
        "  - A continuous uniform distribution describes a situation where all outcomes in a given range have an equal probability. For example, the probability of getting any value between 0 and 1 is the same in a continuous uniform distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What are the characteristics of a normal distribution?\n",
        "  - A normal distribution is symmetric, bell-shaped, with its mean, median, and mode all equal. It is defined by two parameters: mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ). About 68% of data falls within 1σ, 95% within 2σ, and 99.7% within 3σ.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is the standard normal distribution, and why is it important?\n",
        "  - The standard normal distribution is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It is important because it simplifies calculations and allows comparison of data from different normal distributions using z-scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in statistics?\n",
        "  - The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population's distribution. It’s critical because it allows for inference about population parameters using normal distribution, even with non-normally distributed data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution?\n",
        "  - The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of sample means will approximate a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population's original distribution. This makes the normal distribution a useful model for inference in many cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is the application of Z statistics in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "  - Z statistics are used in hypothesis testing to determine whether a sample mean significantly differs from a population mean. It helps assess the probability of observing a result under the null hypothesis, using the standard normal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "16. How do you calculate a Z-score, and what does it represent?\n",
        "  - A Z-score is calculated as **(X - μ) / σ**, where **X** is the data point, **μ** is the mean, and **σ** is the standard deviation. It represents how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are point estimates and interval estimates in statistics?\n",
        "  - Point estimates provide a single value estimate of a population parameter (e.g., sample mean). Interval estimates provide a range of values (e.g., confidence interval) within which the population parameter is likely to lie.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis?\n",
        "  - Confidence intervals estimate the range within which a population parameter is likely to fall, with a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95%). They provide a measure of uncertainty and precision in statistical analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the relationship between a Z-score and a confidence interval?\n",
        "  - A Z-score is used to calculate the margin of error in confidence intervals for population means. It determines the number of standard deviations from the mean, and the corresponding Z-value helps define the range of the confidence interval.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "20.  How are Z-scores used to compare different distributions?\n",
        "  - Z-scores standardize data points from different distributions, allowing comparison by converting them to a common scale with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. This makes it easier to compare values across different datasets or distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What are the assumptions for applying the Central Limit Theorem?\n",
        "  - The Central Limit Theorem assumes that the sample size is sufficiently large (typically n > 30) and that the samples are independent. For non-normal populations, the sample size should be large enough for the sampling distribution of the mean to approach normality.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the concept of expected value in a probability distribution?\n",
        "  - The expected value is the weighted average of all possible outcomes in a probability distribution, where each outcome is multiplied by its probability. It represents the long-term average or mean of the random variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does a probability distribution relate to the expected outcome of a random variable?\n",
        "  - A probability distribution shows all possible outcomes of a random variable and their associated probabilities. The expected outcome (or expected value) is the weighted average of these outcomes, reflecting the long-term average if the experiment is repeated many times.\n",
